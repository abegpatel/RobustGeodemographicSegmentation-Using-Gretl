1.visualize ds
2.encode the ds
3.fit the model(step by step backward elemination)p vale-low and r and adjusted r-squared is more
   p<sv(0.05) and adjusted r-squaredmore(best model)
4.transforamtion(x^2,sqrt(x),ln(x))
5.check multico-linearlity(should be low)
     Use transformation and fit into model and chech for lower co-linearity
     use co-relation matrix
